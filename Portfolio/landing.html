          <p class="job">Virtual Assistant – <i>April 2022 – March 2023</i></p>
          <p class="va">Embarking on my journey as a Virtual Assistant at EXP Realty from April 2022 to March 2023 was like stepping into a whirlwind of opportunities, and I had the pleasure of working alongside Hera Boncaros. In those 11 months, I found myself wearing many hats, each one adding a new layer to my adventure in the world of real estate and administration.
            <br><br>During my 11 months as a Virtual Assistant at EXP Realty, I navigated a whirlwind of opportunities alongside Hera Boncaros. From managing a massive contact tracing database with over a thousand entries, where attention to detail became second nature, to taking charge of EXP Realty's social media, turning regular updates into creative buzz for potential clients.
            <br><br>Crafting and editing content for the company's website was a delightful balancing act of creativity and tech-savviness. The Facebook Marketplace was my digital playground, ensuring every interaction felt like a virtual handshake in the vibrant world of real estate.
            <br><br>But it didn't end there. As a backstage crew member, I supported various projects within the Real Estate Company, from marketing initiatives to client communications. Each day brought a new adventure, and I loved every moment of contributing to the team's success.     
            <br><br> Looking back, my time as a Virtual Assistant wasn't just about tasks on a to-do list; <span class="bold">it was a journey of growth, learning, and getting my hands dirty in the real-world dynamics of the real estate game. EXP Realty wasn't just a workplace; it was a community where each day brought a new challenge and a chance to make a real impact.</span>
